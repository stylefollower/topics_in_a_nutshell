In JavaScript, Strings are values made up of text and can contain letters, numbers, symbols, punctuation, and even emojis!

Strings in JavaScript are contained within a pair of either single quotation marks '' or double quotation marks "". Both quotes represent strings but be sure to choose one and STICK WITH IT. If you start with a single quote, you need to end with a single quote.
